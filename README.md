# To-Do List
This is a to-do list built in C++. This is a very simple project.

## Overview
The basic overview of this project is very simple, to add and remove tasks that need to be done - or have already been done. Tasks that need to be done will be stored in a list, while tasks that are already done will be removed from the list.

## Goal
The implementation of this project is done in C++, the reason being to work with the linked list data structure. There is no user interface for this project. Since there is no user interface for this project, the project runs in the terminal for now. However, another version of this will be done in ReactJS.
